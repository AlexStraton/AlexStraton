## Hi there 👋
### About Me

💻 I’m an avid software engineer passionate about constantly learning and building efficient systems and applications that make a positive impact around the world.

🚀 After transitioning out of teaching and traslation, I attended the Northcoders bootcamp to sharpen my skills. I am now in my first junior full-stack developer role. 

✨ What excites me most about tech is that coding allows me to be creative and find solutions that make a real difference for stakeholders!
